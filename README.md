# ActivBrain

## Description
The goal of this app is to provide daily brain exercises (trivia, math, and reading) for seniors in an effort to prevent the onset of dementia and other degenerative memory issues. 
 You can complete the exercises without an account, however, you cannot save your progress or high scores.
